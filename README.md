# NeutrinoFlux
This package predicts the yearly rate of neutrino events in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the south pole. For this purpose, this package also includes modules with functions for neutrino cross sections, differential flux from atmospheric and astrophysical sources, and attenuation through the earth.

To allow for compatibility with other packages, this package uses classes for `Neutrino`s and `CrossSection`s, whose default attributes and methods can be replaced with other functions as desired.

For a full report on the mathematics used in this package and a notebook showing this package in action, see the `examples` folder.
